# DSA
Starting my 1,000 Data Structures and Algorithm Problems Challenge today (17th Februrary, 2022). Looking forward to learning efficient ways to solve a problem and train my brain to perceive and divide every problem into blocks and DS.
I'll update this README whenever I'll:
1. Find something really interesting
2. Solve a problem in a way I never thought before
3. ......


I hope this is not a week, month or year thing but, instead a life long learning.

And last but not the least, "Hello, World!" 
<because, even with a bachelor's degree, 3+ years of Work Experinece and 2 months into my Masters of Applied Computer Science program; creating a GIT Repo with a challenge is still something I haven't done. So, "Hello, World!">
